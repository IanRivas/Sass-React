Since completing the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. “',

I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful thing about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took  my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent experience. it certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! ”',
